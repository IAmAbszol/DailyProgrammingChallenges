This one was buggy and had to turn for help after proc

Addressing the server, in 2 it tries to CAT a file, literally.

proc yields all the information for current on going actions and file system information.

This is where it drops off, consulting other guides, ../../../../../../proc/self/exe gives us the idea of this flag file, my binary didn't yield that.

Google CTF shows a flags file, using
../flag will give the password.
