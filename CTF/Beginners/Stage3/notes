Proceed as usual

Hexedit icon file, driver.txt resides within (After looking at google ctf notes, we can actually 
note that pk is a zip header)

unzip foo.ico or I did
dd if=foo.ico bs=1 skip=422 of=extracted

Doing the previous yields an additional step by running line 6 on extracted.

driver.txt is yielded.
