These are challenges taken from the site.txt which actually
just links to the reddit page of all interview questions a user
had compiled.

Some questions are ommitted since I've already tackled them and I 
deemed it unnecessary to reproduce (Ex. #2. Use a hash map and value is it's
differenced sum, if 4 points then nested loop followed by two points low and high
to traverse through the rest of the array).
