<h2>Learning Node.js</h2>
<h4>I enrolled into this lecture on codewithmosh.com</h4>
<p>I wanted to learn Node.js as its becoming more relevant in the modern world, I have found that ReactJS and other forms are... annoying to implement. I've programmed heavily in JavaScript before and Node.js feels like a strange mix between JS and Python, therefore learning this will be fun.</p>
</br>
<p>I highly suggest enrolling and learning Node.js as I snagged it for only 15 dollars!</p>
