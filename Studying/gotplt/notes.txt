got --> Global offset table, filled in by the linker etiher statically or dynamically.

plt --> Procedure Linkage Table, stubs that look up addresses in the got.plt section. 
Either triggers the code to lookup address or simply hop to the address.

.got.plt --> Contains target addresses or an address back in the plt (Procedure lookup table). Was originally part of the .got section.

.plt.got --> Procedure linkage table coupled with a Global offset table, contains code to jump to the first entry of the got.


To obtain section headers, objdump -h plt
VMA - Virtual memory address denotes where the section is ran when the program is ran.
LMA - Load memory address denotes where the section is to be loaded.
Most of the time these are equal, case in which they aren't could be within a ROM section.
