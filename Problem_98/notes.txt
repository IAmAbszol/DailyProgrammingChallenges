This is a boggle type algorithm, treat every element as a node.

The objective is for every node, create a set of visited. Perform a DFS approach and traverse under these conditions
1. Node we are at is the correct index letter of our word. Ex. Word: node, at node d, index 2 should be d as well.
2. We are still within the bounds of the board.
3. We are not back on the same node, we check this using visited set.

If we reach the end while following these rules, return true.
Then we actually get more into our DFS by splitting into the 4 directions or 8 directions made possible.

Not goin to code this one out as it's straight forward but its good to know.
