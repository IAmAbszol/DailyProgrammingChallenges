This problem was asked online and I wanted to touch base on it and explain the two ways that I can think about this.

Let there be a cube of 10x10x10 dimensions, like a Rubix cube.
Thus it should be thought of as each cube being of 1x1x1 dimension within this 10x10x10 cube.
The outside of the cube as been completely covered in paint, knowing this:

	1. How many of the cubes have been painted?
	2. Follow-up: How many cubes have NOT been painted?

Method 1: Instinctively I leaned towards a physical representation as numbers are great and all but 
physically it makes all the better.

The cube as we know is of 1,000 smaller cubes that reside within.

Let's focus on the first part of the question, knowing this, there should be 600 FACES covered.
We know this by each face having 100 cubes and there are 6 sides on a cube. 

This then beckons the question of overlap and yes it does have much overlap.

For a physical sense, lets represent the connection between two points as an edge, thus those points now may be
represented as a vertex. We know this since an edge is always connected by two vertices.

Now we should have the following data recorded
600 faces covered
12 Edges (Draw it out)
8 Vertices

Each edge must then have 10 cubes on it. We must subtract those 10 from each edge
since there is a distinct overlap.

Think of it as a piece of paper overlapping with another.

So 600 - 10 * 12 = 480.

The problem with this and if you've taken a Probabilty class is that we have subtracted from
the main souce but have left a hole where the vertices are. But how?

If we had four pieces of paper, all overlapping one another on their edges. Subtracting this from all four
would leave a hole in the center. Those edges led to that vertex, the vertex is the hole.

Thus we now must add the number of vertices back into the problem to get our final answer.

Therefore, 480 + 8 = 488.


The follow up question is taking 1,000 and subtracting from 488 to receive our answer. Again, in probability land, this
is our axiom.

1000 - 488 = 512.


Method 2: Thinking in a physical sense and a little humor, think of the cube as an onion.
The paint is all around the outside, being our outter layer, thus if we peel it, the remaining would be
10 - 2 = 8 for each.

Imagine we had a 4x4x4 cube, lets look at the front face

4x4

Peeling this
1	1	1	1
1	1	1	1
1	1	1	1
1	1	1	1

Set all outisde 1's to 0's
0	0	0	0
0	1	1	0
0	1	1	0
0	0	0	0

Hence our equation works out.

Returning back to our Rubix cube, we will have 8x8x8 sides untouched.

1000 - 512 (8x8x8) = 488. Therefore 488 cubes have been untouched.

We have just found the solution to problem 2 as well, 8x8x8 cubes have been untouched by the delayering, thus 512.
