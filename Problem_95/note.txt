I truly didn't understand the philosphy behind this problem or how to go about it.

Reading the paragraph introducing it, it makes sense that a brute force solution is possible
but maybe more context next time as to how the list provided is transformed to the list generated.

The key to take away from this is *greater*, how do you define greater in any way. Very broad.
